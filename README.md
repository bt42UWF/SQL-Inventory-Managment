# SQL Practice Code Example
This code is for creating and managing an inventory database. It begins by creating a table named "Inventory" to store product information such as ProductID, ProductName, Quantity, Price, Category, Expiry Date (ExpDate), and Manufacturer. Then, it inserts some sample data into the table and performs various operations like selecting data, grouping products by manufacturer, deleting a product, updating product information, adding a new column to the table, and updating data in the new column.

Additionally, it demonstrates the usage of transactions by updating the quantity and price of a product within a transaction block and committing the changes. Lastly, it selects products that are going to expire soon, specifically within the next three months.
